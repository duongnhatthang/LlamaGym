# LlamaGym
"Agents" originated in reinforcement learning, where they learn by interacting with an environment and receiving a reward signal. However, LLM-based agents today do not learn online (i.e. continuously in real time) via reinforcement.

OpenAI created [Gym](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) to standardize and simplify RL environments, but if you try dropping an LLM-based agent into a Gym environment for training, you'd find it's still quite a bit of code to handle LLM conversation context, episode batches, reward assignment, PPO setup, and more.

LlamaGym seeks to simplify fine-tuning LLM agents with RL. Right now, it's a single `Agent` abstract class that handles all the issues mentioned above, letting you quickly iterate and experiment with agent prompting & hyperparameters across any Gym environment.

## Usage
Fine-tuning an LLM-based agent to play in a Gym-style environment with RL has never been easier! Once you install LlamaGym...
```
pip install llamagym
```

First, implement 3 abstract methods on the Agent class:
```python
from llamagym import Agent

class BlackjackAgent(Agent):
    def get_system_prompt(self) -> str:
        return "You are an expert blackjack player."

    def format_observation(self, observation) -> str:
        return f"Your current total is {observation[0]}"

    def extract_action(self, response: str):
        return 0 if "stay" in response else 1
```

Then, define your base LLM (as you would for any fine-tuning job) and instantiate your agent:
```python
model = AutoModelForCausalLMWithValueHead.from_pretrained("Llama-2-7b").to(device)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Llama-2-7b")
agent = BlackjackAgent(model, tokenizer, device)
```

Finally, write your RL loop as usual and simply call your agent to act, reward, and terminate:
```python
env = gym.make("Blackjack-v1")

for episode in trange(5000):
    observation, info = env.reset()
    done = False

    while not done:
        action = agent.act(observation) # act based on observation
        observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
        agent.assign_reward(reward) # provide reward to agent
        done = terminated or truncated

    train_stats = agent.terminate_episode() # trains if batch is full
```

Some reminders:
- above code snippets are mildly simplified above but a fully working example is available in [`examples/blackjack.py`](https://github.com/KhoomeiK/LlamaGym/blob/main/examples/blackjack.py)
- getting online RL to converge is notoriously difficult so you'll have to mess with hyperparameters to see improvement
  - your model may also benefit from a supervised fine-tuning stage on sampled trajectories before running RL (we may add this feature in the future)
- our implementation values simplicity so is not as compute efficient as e.g. [Lamorel](https://github.com/flowersteam/lamorel), but easier to start playing around with
- LlamaGym is a weekend project and still a WIP, but we love contributions!
